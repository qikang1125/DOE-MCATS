# M-CATS: Multi-level Connected and Automated Transit System

The M-CATS project advances a new paradigm of public transit that is **adaptive, equitable, and automated**, targeting mobility and energy justice for disadvantaged communities. The project is piloted in the Illinois Medical District (IMD), focusing on low-income patients and healthcare workers.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Enhance mobility access to critical services for disadvantaged groups
- Implement and test adaptive, real-time control strategies for transit
- Leverage AI, eco-driving, and automation to reduce GHG emissions
- Evaluate equity and performance impacts in real-world deployments

## 🔧 Core Modules

- **Demand Sensing & Prediction**: Deep learning-based spatiotemporal models
- **Transit Operations Control**: Real-time, schedule-free control algorithms
- **Eco-Driving & Routing**: Energy-efficient routing under fairness constraints
- **Equity Analysis**: Community-informed metric evaluation with stakeholder feedback

## 🧪 Pilot Phases

1. **Phase 1** – Real-time communications & sensing on Route 9 buses
2. **Phase 2** – Schedule-free operation trial along Ashland Avenue
3. **Phase 3** – Automated shuttle pilot with Cruise AV in IMD
